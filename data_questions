Questions about our data:
- How do we differentiate between the two Anderson Jrs in the catapult data?

Carly notes for Matthew:
Potential next steps:
-Adding colors to the table values like in the video Brian showed
-commenting the data cleaning code (done)
-investigating why some athletes have position NA, “”, or “ “ (done)
-adding the weird valueboxes in the app in Brian’s video??? not sure what those do?
-keeping the session time/name or creating some sort of session ID? Right now sessions are not unique by name/date/position which makes the tables look really wonky in the shiny  (done)
